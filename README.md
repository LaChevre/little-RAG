# PC Components RAG Trainer

## Overview

This project is a self-built Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application focused on PC components.

## Purpose 

The goal of this project is to enhance my skills in both RAG technology for personal and professional growth.

## Futur Plans

- Enhanced Database: Develop a well-structured database optimized for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
- Improved Retrieval Algorithm: Refine the algorithm for more effective extraction from the database.
- Advanced Prompt Engineering: Enhance prompt design and integrate more sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs).
