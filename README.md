# PC Components RAG Trainer

## Overview

This project is a self-built Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application focused on PC components.

## Purpose 

The goal of this project is to enhance my skills in both RAG technology for personal and professional growth.



## Finished

- **Enhanced Database**: Developed a well-structured database optimized for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
  - Created a SQLite database with optional indexing (currently unnecessary due to the small size of the database) ✅

## In Progress

- **Improved Retrieval Algorithm**: Refining the algorithm for more effective extraction from the database.
  - Added BERT embeddings ✅
  - Setting up an ANNOY architecture

## Future Upgrades

- **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Enhance prompt design and integrate more sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs).
- **User Interface Development**: Design and implement a user-friendly interface.
